# sms_spam_detector
The purpose of this assignment was to create a code from SMS text classification into a function that constructs a linear Support Vector Classification (SVC) model. Python coding language was used as well as the interface Gradio to build this application. The application classified text messages as spam or ham. 
This was the first time using Gradio. It is an interesting interface that can be used to create text boxes for input and output messages. I am looking forward to exploring the other applications of Gradio in future assignments.
